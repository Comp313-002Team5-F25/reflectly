Reflectly

Reflectly is a privacy-first, AI-powered reflective conversation web application designed to help users feel heard, gain emotional clarity, and engage in deeper self-reflection through guided, non-clinical dialogue.

Unlike traditional chatbots or wellness apps, Reflectly focuses on active listening: it paraphrases a user’s thoughts to demonstrate understanding, then asks one gentle follow-up question (or offers structured steps when explicitly requested) to encourage meaningful reflection.

This repository serves as both a working product prototype and a case study demonstrating thoughtful UX, accessibility, and ethical AI design.

✨ Key Principles

Reflection over advice
The default interaction style mirrors empathetic listening rather than problem-solving.

Privacy-first by design
Sessions are ephemeral. No accounts. No permanent chat history.

Accessibility as a feature
Built with keyboard navigation, reduced motion, high contrast, and scalable typography in mind.

Intent-aware AI
Users can choose between reflective exploration or structured guidance when appropriate.

Non-clinical & ethical
Reflectly is not a medical or therapeutic system and makes no diagnostic claims.

🧠 How Reflectly Works

The user enters a thought, concern, or reflection.

The system:

Paraphrases the user’s message to demonstrate understanding

Generates one relevant, open-ended follow-up question
(or 2–3 structured steps if the user switches intent)

The conversation continues in a calm, low-pressure loop.

When the session ends:

Lightweight usage metrics (e.g., turn count, latency) may be stored

Message content is discarded

This approach encourages emotional clarity without overwhelming the user or storing sensitive data.
